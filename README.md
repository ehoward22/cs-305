Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial institution that was trying to add security to their application.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I enoyed the testing aspect to this and seeing what vulnerabilities were where via code but the final project itself was more difficult than I thought so I didn't like that.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I prefered looking that the dependency check tool vs the dependency check by hand.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

Testing the vulnerabiltiies were caused by old libraries so when we updated the said libraries the code got more secure and the application was safer for the future.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
